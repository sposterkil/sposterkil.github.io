title: It's Been a while!
---

Well, it certainly has been a while.  I'm back with a shiny new domain name, if nothing else of note.  I've finished a few projects since my last update, take a look at [gman](https://github.com/sposterkil/gman) if you're looking for a super simple way to issue git commands in bulk to a group of repositories by tag.  The interface is reasonably intuitive.  

In other news, I'm nearly done with my eighth semester of college at Case, though I've got one semester to go.  I'll be graduating at the end of 2015,   this semester and next will be my last two courses in the CS department, as well as finishing up a minor in Cognitive Science.  This semester has been good, and next should be as well!  

My current project is an as-yet-unnamed music player for OS X, since I've never been quite satisfied with any of the existing options.  [VOX](http://coppertino.com) is *almost* what I want, but hasn't been cooperating with me lately.  [Swinsian](http://swinsian.com) is pretty awesome, and may actually be what I end up using even when I'm done with my player, but I'm holding off on buying it until I know if I'm happy with what I can make or not.  

My current method of managing music is a pretty vanilla installation of [beets](http://beets.radbox.org), which is basically my favorite thing.  I'd honestly probably be happy with iTunes if only it could play flac!  I'm not enthusiastic about transcoding a significant portion of my library (1300 songs!) from flac to ALAC.  

Next semester I'll be working on my Senior Project, so expect some updates about that if I remember to post.  Over the summer I hope to be interning as a programmer somewhere, so that's a potential source of material as well.
