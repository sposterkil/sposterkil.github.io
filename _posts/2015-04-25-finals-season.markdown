Yep, it's that time of year.  Fortunately I only have the one final this year, in the Anthropology class that I'm taking to fill out some requirements.  Looking back on the semester, I liked most of my classes.  

## ANTH 103 - Intro to Human Evolution ##
Not this one, so much.  Interesting subject matter, but the grading schema (Four tests, your grade is the best three) and test content (memorization for days, not that that's unexpected) made it fairly painful.  I won't complain about having taken it, but I won't look back on it with an overabundance of fondness either.

## COGS 202 - Human Cognition Viewed From a Cultural Perspective ##
This class was great.  William Deal is a really entertaining professor.  Personable, engaging, opinionated.  The subject matter was really interesting: how does culture arise from cognition, or is it the other way around; what constitutes a culture; what constitutes *cognition*; can you have one without the other...  A lot of really fantastic discussion for a class of this size.  Grading schema is a highlight here, Professor Deal uses an "XP-based" system where you earn points for doing whatever assignments/tests/quizzes/in-class activities, which is both easy to understand and motivating.  

## COGS 301 - Special Topics in Cognitive Science: Elements of Surprise ##
Also excellent.  Vera Tobin is another great professor in the COGS department, and the other students in the class are all entertaining people.  Weekly presentations on some element of surprise in cognition meant we got a lot of spoilers, but also a lot of excellent book/movie/game recommendations.  

## EECS 338 - Introduction to Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming ##
Emphasis on "and Concurrent Programming."  Most of the work we did was on multi-process and multi-threaded programming, along with associated concurrency constructs (semaphores, monitors, locks, etc.).  Homework assignments were interesting, and difficult enough to feel make you feel proud when you finish them.  The *grading* of those homeworks left a little to be desired, both in speed and in terms of justification.  I often felt that the TAs didn't have a very clear idea of what they were grading on.  
Tekin has been teaching this class for a very long time, and he's good at it but the curriculum does feel somewhat dated.  This is a complaint I've had about a few courses in the EECS department, actually: intelligent, skilled professors - who are still teaching the technologies they learned when they were in college.  It's not every course, but it's a trend I've noticed.  
Regardless, I enjoyed 338, and I definitely learned things from it.
