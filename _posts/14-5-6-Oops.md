Well, that whole "actually blogging" thing didn't happen quite as I wanted it to.  The pareto project is long finished, and I just finished finals for my third year of college, which is a little weird.

My next project is probably `gman`, a **g**it **man**ager and subtle Half Life reference.  I wanted a tool I could use to update and check the status of all the various git repos I work on/follow, and none of the existing tools work quite the way I want them to.  So I figure "Hey, an opportunity to play around in Python."  The repo is [here](https://github.com/sposterkil/gman), but there's nothing up yet.  Updates to follow.
