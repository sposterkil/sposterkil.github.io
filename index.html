		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am Sam Osterkil, 20 year old Computer Science student at Case Western Reserve University.  I am a programmer at heart, focused on the little things, and skilled at independent goal-oriented action.</p>
		<p>I know Java, Python, and how to learn a language; Photoshop and Pixelmator; OS X and Windows.  I've been using computers since I was ten, and I've been tweaking them to do what I want for almost as long.</p>
		<p>I came to Case undecided on a major, but thinking I'd end up in Physics or Computer Science.  My first semester I took Intro Physics and Intro to Java, and I immediately knew which I wanted to do.  Physics was fun, but I liked the grand ideas more than the concrete reality of it, and my first contact with a "real" programming language was exactly as exciting as I hoped it would be.</p>
		<p>Since then, I've picked up a few interesting side-projects.  My current undertaking is a tool to help categorize issue reports for trucks at International Truck and Engine, hopefully reducing a currently week-long process into a few minutes.  I also intend to use this as a learning project to pick up Perl.</p>
