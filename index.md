#About Me
I am Sam Osterkil, 20 year old Computer Science student at Case Western Reserve University.  I am a programmer at heart, focused on the little things, and skilled at independent goal-oriented action.  

I know Java, Python, and how to learn a language; Photoshop and Pixelmator; OS X and Windows.  I've been using computers since I was ten, and I've been tweaking them to do what I want for almost as long.
