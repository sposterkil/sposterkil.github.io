<h1 id="aboutme">About Me</h1>

<p>I am Sam Osterkil, 22 year old programmer at heart, focused on the little things, skilled at independent goal-oriented action.</p>

<p>I know Java, Python, C, and how to learn a language; Photoshop and Pixelmator; OS X, Windows and a few flavors of Linux. I’ve been using computers since I was ten, and I’ve been tweaking them to do what I want for almost as long.</p>

<p>I came to Case undecided on a major, but thinking I’d end up in Physics or Computer Science. My first semester I took Intro Physics and Intro to Java, and I immediately knew which I wanted to do. Physics was fun, but I liked the grand ideas more than the concrete reality of it, and my first contact with a “real” programming language was exactly as exciting as I hoped it would be.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve picked up a few interesting side-projects. My most recent undertaking (for my senior project at Case) was <em>Euphonus</em>, a music player for OS X. Built because I wanted something simple that could play FLAC and look nice, and because I wanted to learn the Xcode toolchain. Overall it went well enough: time constraints proved problematic, but I had a functioning program at the end of the year. </p>
