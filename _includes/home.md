#About Me
I am Sam Osterkil, 20 year old Computer Science student at Case Western Reserve University.  I am a programmer at heart, focused on the little things, and skilled at independent goal-oriented action.  

I know Java, Python, and how to learn a language; Photoshop and Pixelmator; OS X and Windows.  I've been using computers since I was ten, and I've been tweaking them to do what I want for almost as long.  

I came to Case undecided on a major, but thinking I'd end up in Physics or Computer Science.  My first semester I took Intro Physics and Intro to Java, and I immediately knew which I wanted to do.  Physics was fun, but I liked the grand ideas more than the concrete reality of it, and my first contact with a "real" programming language was exactly as exciting as I hoped it would be.  

Since then, I've picked up a few interesting side-projects.  My current undertaking is `gman`, a(nother) tool for managing and tagging multiple git repositories.
