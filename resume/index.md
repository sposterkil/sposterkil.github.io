# Résumé #

## Skills ##
My strongest programming languages are Python, Java, and C, in roughly that order.  I also know a smattering of C# and a decent amount of Objective-C, and I know my way around HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm equally comfortable in Windows, Mac, or Linux-based operating systems, though I prefer Mac or Linux for development.  I'm also proficient with the Git and Subversion version control systems.  

## Education ##
I am currently waiting to recieve my diploma from [Case Western Reserve University](http://case.edu/).

### College ###
I was a Computer Science student of the Class of 2015 (or 2016.  I'm expecting my diploma to arrive sometime in January.) at [Case Western](http://case.edu/), in Cleveland, Ohio.

###High School ### 
I was homeschooled through [Clonlara School](http://www.clonlara.org/), a private, accredited, home-based education program, Class of 2011.

### Outside of school ### 
I participated in a Robotics course at the [Indiana Institute of Technology](http://www.indianatech.edu/), from December 2008 to April 2009.

## Work History ##

### Polycom ###
Over the summer of 2015 I worked at [Polycom](http://www.polycom.com) as a Software Engineering Intern.  While there I worked on expanding their automated test suite to cover some new functionality in the API, was part of a team examining inconsistencies in the user interfaces to their various products, and built an HTML5-based interface to one of those with the other interns.

I will return to Polycom in a full-time position as a software engineer in January.  

##Side Projects
* I created a basic IRC bot in Python, as a project to help me learn the language.
* I administered a Minecraft server for a 10-20 person userbase, running on a standard 1U server in the basement.
* I built a tool to generate tags from large CSV files, for use in an internal ticketing system at [International Truck and Engine](http://www.internationaltrucks.com/trucks/). 
* I wrote a [Python script](https://github.com/sposterkil/gman) to manage all the various git repositories on my computer by tag, so I can update them in bulk.  
* For my senior project, I created a lightweight music player with support for a broad variety of formats.  I wasn't happy with any of the existing offerings, so I made my own.    

##Service
* I volunteered on the Allen County Public Library (ACPL) Teen Advisory Board from 2009 to 2011, where I helped maintain the Young Adults department, reviewed pre-release copies of books for publishers, and acted as an assistant in running several library programs.  
* I also participated in the Great American Clean-Up those same years, working in groups around the city to pick up litter and debris.  
* Finally, I administered the Fort Wayne Homeschooler's Volunteering group from 2008 to 2010.  We organized several activities for local homeschoolers, including a eyeglass collection drive for the Lions organization.
