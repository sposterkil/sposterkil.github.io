# Résumé #

## Skills ##
I am skilled in Python, Java, and C programming, familiar with C#; comfortable in the UNIX shell; and I know my way around Windows, Mac, and Linux-based operating systems.  I'm also proficient with the Git version control system.  

## Education ##
I am currently a senior with one semester to go at [Case Western Reserve University](http://case.edu/).

### College ###
I am a Computer Science student of the Class of 2015 (or 2016.  I'm graduating in December.) at [Case Western](http://case.edu/), in Cleveland, Ohio.

###High School ### 
I was homeschooled through [Clonlara School](http://www.clonlara.org/), a private, accredited, home-based education program, Class of 2011.

### Outside of school ### 
I participated in a Robotics course at the [Indiana Institute of Technology](http://www.indianatech.edu/), from December 2008 to April 2009.

## Work History ##

### Polycom ###
I am currently working at [Polycom](http://www.polycom.com) over the summer of 2015 as a Software Engineering Intern.  I worked on expanding their automated test suite to cover some new functionality in the API, was part of a team examining inconsistencies in the user interfaces to their various products, and am currently building an HTML5-based interface to one of those.

##Side Projects
* I created a basic IRC bot in Python, as a project to help me learn the language.
* I administered a Minecraft server for a 10-20 person userbase, running on a standard 1U server in the basement.
* I built a tool to generate tags from large CSV files, for use in an internal ticketing system at [International Truck and Engine](http://www.internationaltrucks.com/trucks/). 
* I wrote a [Python script](https://github.com/sposterkil/gman) to manage all the various git repositories on my computer by tag, so I can update them in bulk.  
* I'm currently working on a simple music player for OS X, because I'm really not happy with any of the existing offerings.  I just want a simple interface that can play FLAC, but it'll also serve as an opportunity to learn Xcode. 

##Service
* I volunteered on the Allen County Public Library (ACPL) Teen Advisory Board from 2009 to 2011, where I helped maintain the Young Adults department, reviewed pre-release copies of books for publishers, and acted as an assistant in running several library programs.  
* I also participated in the Great American Clean-Up those same years, working in groups around the city to pick up litter and debris.  
* Finally, I administered the Fort Wayne Homeschooler's Volunteering group from 2008 to 2010.  We organized several activities for local homeschoolers, including a eyeglass collection drive for the Lions organization.
